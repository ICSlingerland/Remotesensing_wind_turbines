# Creating a mission: How to use remote sensing to observe the affect of Wind Turbines in the North Sea on the Sedimentology.

## Overview

The Netherlands is gearing up for a significant expansion of wind turbine parks in the North Sea, a crucial step in the nation's energy transition. However, there is limited understanding of the potential ecological impact on both the North Sea and the Wadden Sea. This project focuses specifically on investigating how offshore wind turbines affect sediments and, more importantly, proposes methods to monitor the sedimentology of the North Sea in response to wind turbine installations.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to develop a remote sensing mission dedicated to monitoring sea sediments, with a special focus on the North Sea. By delving into the sedimentology, our aim is to contribute valuable insights into the ecological consequences of expanding wind turbine infrastructure in this region.

## Scope

This research is part of the Master course in Earth Observation Technologies. As a collaborative effort among a group of dedicated students, we aim to design a remote sensing mission that will enable us to monitor and analyze the effects of wind turbines on the sediment dynamics of the North Sea.

## Why It Matters

As the push for sustainable energy sources grows, understanding the ecological impact of such initiatives becomes paramount. This project not only addresses the immediate concerns related to the expansion of wind turbines but also contributes to the broader conversation about the balance between renewable energy goals and environmental preservation.

## Get Involved

We welcome collaboration, suggestions, and contributions from the community. Feel free to explore our repository, share your insights, and join us in this mission to enhance our understanding of the ecological implications of offshore wind energy.
